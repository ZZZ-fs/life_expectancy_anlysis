In the past 15 years, there has been a vast improvement in human mortality rates, especially in the developing nations. However, according to MEDRXIV, life expectancy in many countries like the United States is shorter than before due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reflecting the number of COVID-19 deaths nationwide, the topic of life expectancy is brought up again. We are thus interested in performing a data analysis on life expectancy to see how life expectancy will be affected by health and social factors. The main purpose of this project is to construct a multiple linear regression model for life expectancy and to check the modelâ€™s performance through regression diagnostics and simulation study.
